The project includes a SQL script that seeds the database with realistic sample data. This seed data populates all key entities: User, Property, Booking, Payment, Review, and Message. The entries are designed to simulate real-world interactions between users, such as guests booking properties, making payments, leaving reviews, and communicating with hosts. This dataset provides a foundational environment to test API endpoints and application features in a consistent and reliable manner. The seeding script ensures that both host and guest roles are represented and that various booking statuses and payment methods are reflected in the data.
