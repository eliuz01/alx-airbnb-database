To improve the efficiency of data retrieval in our Airbnb backend system, we analyzed and optimized a complex SQL query that joins the bookings, users, properties, and payments tables. The initial query fetched all relevant booking details alongside user, property, and payment information using multiple JOINs. We identified performance bottlenecks using EXPLAIN ANALYZE and improved the query by ensuring appropriate indexes were used (on user_id, property_id, and booking_id), reducing the number of selected columns, and applying a LIMIT clause to control the result set size. Additionally, we simplified output formatting by concatenating user names and ordering results by creation date to enhance query responsiveness. These changes significantly reduced execution time and improved the queryâ€™s scalability for large datasets
