### Partitioning Optimization Report
To enhance the performance of queries on the large `bookings` table, we implemented table partitioning using PostgreSQL's `RANGE` strategy on the `start_date` column. The table was divided into yearly partitions (`bookings_2024`, `bookings_2025`, etc.). After partitioning, queries filtering by date range executed significantly faster due to reduced scan scope. Using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, we observed that only the relevant partition was scanned, leading to more efficient execution. This approach improves scalability and response times for future large datasets.
